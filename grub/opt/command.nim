  Acpi             * = ref object of Command
    ## Modern BIOS systems normally implement the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI), and
    ## define various tables that describe the interface between an
    ## ACPI-compliant operating system and the firmware.
    ## In some cases, the tables provided by default only work well with
    ## certain operating systems, and it may be necessary to replace some of them.
    ## Normally, this command will replace the Root System Description Pointer (RSDP) in the
    ## Extended BIOS Data Area to point to the new tables.
    ## If the --no-ebda option is used, the new tables will be known only to GRUB, but
    ## may be used by GRUB's EFI emulation. Note: The command is not allowed when lockdown is enforced (see Lockdown).
    ## Otherwise an attacker can instruct the GRUB to load an SSDT table to overwrite the
    ## kernel lockdown configuration and later load and execute unsigned code.
  Authenticate     * = ref object of Command

    ## This remains in effect after a payload kernel has been loaded by GRUB,
    ## as long as the loaded kernel obtains its memory map from GRUB.
    ## Kernels that support this include Linux, GNU Mach,
    ## the kernel of FreeBSD and Multiboot kernels in general.
    ## Syntax is the same as provided by the Memtest86+ utility:
    ## a list of address/mask pairs. Given a page-aligned address and
    ## a base address / mask pair, if all the bits of the page-aligned address that
    ## are enabled by the mask match with the base address,
    ## it means this page is to be filtered.
    ## This syntax makes it easy to represent patterns that are
    ## often result of memory damage,
    ## due to physical distribution of memory cells.
    ## The command is similar to cutmem command.
    ## Note: The command is not allowed when lockdown is enforced (see Lockdown).
    ## This prevents removing EFI memory regions to potentially subvert the

    ## 'boot' (boolean)
    ##   When enabled, this makes the selected partition be the
    ##   active (bootable) partition on its disk,
    ##   clearing the active flag on all other partitions.
    ##   This command is limited to primary partitions.
    ## 'type' (value)Change the type of an existing partition.
    ##   The value must be a number in the range 0-0xFF
    ##   (prefix with '0x' to enter it in hexadecimal).
    ## 'hidden' (boolean)When enabled, this
    ##   hides the selected partition by setting the
    ##   hidden bit in its partition type code;
    ##   when disabled, unhides the selected partition by
